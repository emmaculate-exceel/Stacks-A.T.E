## Stacks Wallet Integration

The application uses Stacks Connect for wallet authentication:

```javascript
import { showConnect } from '@stacks/connect';

const connectStacksWallet = async () => {
  showConnect({
    appDetails: {
      name: 'African Trade Empire',
      icon: window.location.origin + '/appIcon.jpg',
    },
    redirectTo: '/',
    onFinish: (data) => {
      setStacksUser(data.userSession.loadUserData());
    },
    network: 'testnet'
  });
};
```

## Crypto Trading Game

The Crypto Caravan game allows players to trade BTC, STX, and sBTC between global markets with different price multipliers. Players can:

1. Choose a trader (representing a caravan in the original game)
2. Select a destination city 
3. Choose which cryptocurrency to trade
4. Complete trades to earn profit based on market differences
5. After 10 turns, withdraw earnings to their connected wallet
